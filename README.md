# Custom-Qualtrics-Solutions

I have often had to go outside of the box of what Qualtrics is capabable of implementing in its "point and click" functionality. This repo is used to give just some example snippets of JavaScript/HTML/CSS code I've used to further customize the functionality of Qualtrics. 

Note that because of the specific way that Qualtrics allows you to add custom JS/HTML/CSS, I've found it easier in my specific workflow to put all of these into one document (rather than spread out by language). Therefore, some of the .js files also include the requisite HTML/CSS to go along with the JS. I have noted where each piece of code should go within the survey, relative to Qualtrics' interface. Sometimes the .QSF file (i.e. "Qualtrics Survey Format" file) is also included for context.
