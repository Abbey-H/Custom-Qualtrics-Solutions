# Custom-Qualtrics-Solutions

I have often had to go outside of the box of what Qualtrics is capabable of implementing in its "point and click" functionality. This repo is used to give some snippets of JavaScript/HTML/CSS code I've used to further customize the functionality of Qualtrics. 

Sometimes the .QSF file (i.e. "Qualtrics Survey Format" file) is also included for context.
